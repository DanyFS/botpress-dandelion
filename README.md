# botpress-dandelion

Unofficial Botpress module for Dandelion (http://dandelion.eu). This module lets you analyze incoming messages by processing the text through Dandelion powerful API.
At the moment it only extracts Entities from messages. See the Contribution section if you want to see more features!


## Installation

Installing modules on Botpress is simple. By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add messenger module to their bot.

```js
botpress install dandelion
```

## Updated List of supported API endpoints

 - Entity Extraction ([docs](https://dandelion.eu/docs/api/datatxt/nex/v1/))

## Contribution

As this module relies on [dandelion-api](https://github.com/giulioprinaricotti/node-dandelion) any help on that library might be appreciated.
The library is very limitated so no expansions seems possible for this module until the library is more mature.
